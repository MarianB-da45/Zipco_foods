## Executive Summary for Zipco Foods
Zipco Foods is a vibrant and growing business that specializes in the sales of pizzas and cakes. As a key player in the fast-casual dining industry, Zipco Foods operates numerous outlets across the country, serving a wide variety of pizzas and cakes that cater to local tastes and pre erences. With a strong commitment to customer satisfaction and quality service, Zipco Foods aims to leverage advanced data engineering solutions to enhance operational efficiency, improve product offerings, and ultimately boost profitability.

## Business Problem Statement
Zipco Foods generates a significant amount of sales data daily, which is currently underutilized due to inefficient data handling and analysis processes. The primary challenge is the disparate nature of data collection and storage, with critical sales and inventory information scattered across multiple CSV files without a unified system for aggregation and analysis. This fragmentation leads to operational inefficiencies, including delays in data access, difficulty in obtaining real-time insights, and challenges in maintaining data integrity and accuracy

## Objectives & Benefits
### Objectives:
• ﻿﻿Implement a streamlined ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to automate data processing and ensure data consistency.
• ﻿﻿Design a database schema that supports efficient data retrieval and scalability while adhering to2NF/3NF normalization standards.
• ﻿﻿Develop a system for real-time data analytics to aid in decision-making processes.
• ﻿﻿Ensure robust data governance and compliance through effective version control and data orchestration.
### Benefits:
• ﻿﻿Enhanced decision-making capabilities through real-time, accurate data analytics.
• ﻿﻿Improved operational efficiency and reduced manual labor by automating data processes.
• ﻿﻿Greater scalability and flexibility in data management, accommodating future business growth.
• ﻿﻿Strengthened data integrity and reliability, ensuring high-quality information for strategies planning.

## Tech Stack
• ﻿﻿Python: Utilized for scripting the ETL processes, data cleaning, transformation, and analysis tasks due to its powerful libraries like pandas and NumPy.
• ﻿﻿SQL: Employed for querying, updating, and managing the database stored in Azure, ensuring efficient data manipulation and retrieval.
• ﻿﻿Azure Blob Storage: Chosen for its scalability and reliability, serving as the centralized data repository for storing processed data.
• ﻿﻿Github: Used for version control, allowing for collaborative development and maintenance of the ETL scripts and other project documents.
• ﻿﻿Apache Airflow: Orchestrates the ETL processes, scheduling jobs efficiently monitoring the workflow of data through various stages of the pipeline.

## Project Scope
• ﻿﻿Data Extraction
• Extract data from various CSV files into a Pandas DataFrame. This step involves reading large datasets efficiently, handling different data formats, and managing 
  incomplete or corrupt data files.

• Data Transformation﻿﻿ Clean the extracted data to remove inconsistencies, duplicates, and handle missing values.Transform the data to fit into a designed schema that 
  adheres to the principles of 2NF and 3NF. This involves decomposing tables to reduce redundancy, ensuring referential integrity, and optimizing the schema for query 
  performance

• Data Loading
Load the cleaned and transformed data into Azure Blob Storage, which serves as the centralized repository for all analytical data.

• Implement version control using GitHub to maintain revisions of the data transformation scripts and other configurations.

## Apache Airflow
 Use Apache Airflow to orchestrate the entire ETL process. Define DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) to manage the workflow of tasks including dependencies and sequence of 
 operations, ensuring that the data flows smoothly from extraction through to loading, with logging and error handling to manage failures or retries effectively.

This case study outlines the strategic approach for utilizing advanced data engineering techniques to drive operational improvements and business growth for Zipco Foods.
